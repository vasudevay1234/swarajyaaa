    <i><h2>Introduction</h2></i>
    <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s vision of Swarajya did not end with his reign. After his passing in 1680, his successors, particularly <strong>Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj</strong>, played a crucial role in expanding and defending Swarajya. Over time, the Marathas rose as a dominant power, significantly influencing India’s political and military landscape.</p>

    <h2>Swarajya Expansion After Shivaji Maharaj</h2>
    <p>After Shivaji Maharaj’s death, the responsibility of preserving and expanding Swarajya fell upon his son, <strong>Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj</strong>. However, the path was not easy as the Mughals, led by <strong>Aurangzeb</strong>, intensified their attacks to crush the Marathas.</p>

    <h3>Challenges Faced by Swarajya</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mughal Invasion:</strong> Aurangzeb launched a prolonged military campaign to destroy the Maratha state.</li>
        <li><strong>Internal Conflicts:</strong> Political instability due to factionalism within the Maratha court.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Struggles:</strong> Continuous wars required significant resources and manpower.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Despite these challenges, Swarajya survived and expanded, thanks to the resilience of its leaders and warriors.</p>

    <h2>Contribution of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj (1681–1689)</h2>
<p><a href="images/chava.jpg" target="_blank">Poem Of Sambhaji Maharaj By Sneha Shinde</a></p>
    <p>Sambhaji Maharaj, the eldest son of Shivaji Maharaj, took over the Maratha throne in 1681. His rule was marked by his <strong>bravery, military genius, and resistance against the Mughal Empire</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Major Contributions of Sambhaji Maharaj</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Defending Swarajya Against the Mughals:</strong> Sambhaji Maharaj fought over 120 battles against Aurangzeb’s forces. His aggressive military tactics prevented the Mughals from easily conquering Maharashtra.</li>
        <li><strong>Naval Strength:</strong> He continued his father’s vision of a strong Maratha Navy, keeping a check on Portuguese, Siddis, and British expansion along the western coast.</li>
        <li><strong>Alliance with Foreign Powers:</strong> Sambhaji Maharaj tried to seek alliances with Persia and other foreign rulers to counter the Mughals.</li>
        <li><strong>Sacrifice for Swarajya:</strong> In 1689, he was captured by Aurangzeb, tortured, and executed, but he never accepted Mughal rule or converted to Islam. His martyrdom strengthened Maratha resistance and inspired future generations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rise of the Maratha Empire</h2>
    <p>After Sambhaji Maharaj’s death, the Marathas regrouped and launched an aggressive campaign under <strong>Chhatrapati Rajaram Maharaj</strong>, <strong>Maharani Tarabai</strong>, and later <strong>Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj</strong>. This led to the Marathas expanding their influence across India.</p>
